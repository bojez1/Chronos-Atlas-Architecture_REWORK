# üß† Chronos Atlas: The Knowledge Navigator & Curriculum Roadmap

**A modern, high-performance, data-driven visualization of the lineage of ideas, powered by FastAPI, GraphQL (Strawberry), SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL.**

This project transforms disconnected historical and scientific facts into a visual, relational **Knowledge Graph**. By linking figures, works, and influences across time, Chronos Atlas allows users to map the **lineage of ideas** and build personalized educational roadmaps across disciplines.

## üöÄ Quick Start: Development Environment

All development and administrative tasks are **Docker-first** and executed via `make`.

1. **Start Services:** Build and start the FastAPI (`api`) and PostgreSQL (`db`) containers.

    ```bash
    make up
    ```

2. **Run Migrations:** Apply the database schema from the models.

    ```bash
    make alembic-upgrade
    ```

3. **Load Initial Data:** Execute the "Big Bang" ETL to seed the database with core data.

    ```bash
    make data-load
    ```

4. **Run Tests:** Execute the full test suite.

    ```bash
    make pytest
    ```

The FastAPI application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## üéØ Core Value Proposition: Contextualized Learning at Scale

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Knowledge Roadmap Builder** | The core feature. Trace any advanced **Concept** (e.g., 'Relativity,' 'Calculus') backward to its prerequisite works and foundational concepts, providing a clear, visual curriculum path. |
| **Interdisciplinary Context** | Allows filtering by time, field, and influence to quickly visualize the **simultaneity** of events and contemporaries across different disciplines. |
| **Relational Knowledge Graph** | Built on specific relationship types (`BUILT_ON`, `PREREQUISITE_FOR`, `INFLUENCED`) that enable the deep, graph-like queries essential for the Roadmap logic using PostgreSQL's **`WITH RECURSIVE`** capability. |
| **Interactive Timeline** | Visually displays the lifespan of **Agents** and the chronological sequencing of their **Works** on a scrollable, zoomable interface. |

All detailed plans, architecture, and contracts are documented below.

| Document | Purpose | Key Content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. `ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md`** | **Technical Stack & Schema** | Justifies FastAPI/PostgreSQL, defines the **Knowledge Graph Models**, and specifies the **`WITH RECURSIVE`** query for the Roadmap. |
| **2. `DATA_FLOW_AND_SCALING.md`** | **Operational Logic** | Details the **Asynchronous ETL** pipeline, the **Indexing Strategy**, and the plan for scaling via Redis and Read Replicas. |
| **3. `EXECUTION_ROADMAP.md`** | **Implementation Plan** | Phase-by-phase plan (Foundation, MVP, Production), prioritizing the core **Roadmap** feature. |
| **4. `GRAPHQL_API_CONTRACT.md`** | **Frontend API Contract** | Defines the strict GraphQL types and queries (e.g., `knowledgeRoadmap`) for the Nextra frontend. |
| **5. `WIKIDATA_ETL_SPEC.md`** | **Data Sourcing & Quality** | Detailed **SPARQL Queries**, Wikidata P-Numbers targeted, and **Data Normalization Rules** (e.g., date formatting). |
